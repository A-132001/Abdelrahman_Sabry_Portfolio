                        <p>This donation platform is one of the projects I‚Äôm most proud of ü§ç. It was a great opportunity to apply my backend development skills using Django and to dive deeper into building real-world systems with authentication, APIs, and secure data handling.</p>

                    <ParagraphLight>
                        <p>When I started this project, I had just finished mastering Django‚Äôs MVT architecture, JWT authentication, and third-party OAuth integrations. I wanted to bring all this together in one meaningful project that can actually help others.</p>

                        <p>At first, it looked like a straightforward platform, but it quickly turned into a complex system, especially since it involved three tightly connected Django apps: <strong>accounts</strong>, <strong>campaigns</strong>, and <strong>transactions</strong>.</p>
                    </ParagraphLight>

                    <ParagraphLight>
                        <p>Implementing email verification, Facebook login, and password recovery taught me a lot about authentication systems and user experience. Also, integrating JWT tokens securely pushed me to better understand token-based APIs üîê.</p>
                    </ParagraphLight>

                    <ParagraphLight>
                        <p>I also faced several challenges when designing how campaigns and transactions relate to each other. Modeling these relationships with foreign keys and making sure the data flow was smooth really sharpened my understanding of Django‚Äôs ORM.</p>

                        <p>This project still has room for improvement, especially on the front-end side, but I‚Äôm proud of how it‚Äôs functioning and how much I learned from it. It reflects my progress as a full-stack developer üõ†Ô∏è.</p>

                        <p>Doing courses and tutorials is great, but sometimes is difficult to evaluate how much are we actually learning. Watching video after video and coding along with the instructor gives us very good guidance, but it is not a realistic scenario. In a real-world job, we will have to solve problems and start figuring things out by ourselves (with the help of Google, of course üòâ). So, to test how much I was actually learning during the JavaScript course I was doing I decided to make a simple To-Do app in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>I learned about the importance of structuring HTML in a meaningful semantic way, and how a good HTML structure can make our lives easy when we start working on CSS and JavaScript in later stages of the project.</p>

                    <ParagraphLight>
                        <p>I underestimated CSS üòÖ. The classes names are a bit funny and messy, so in the future, I'll try to implement BEM notation and maybe SASS. I discovered that some behaviour that initially thought of was in the realm of JavaScript can easily be achieved with CSS, such as animations on elements.</p>

                        <p>Regarding JavaScript, this was the first time I coded following the OOP paradigm and, despite feeling a bit out of my element, I now can see the potential that following this paradigm has.</p>
