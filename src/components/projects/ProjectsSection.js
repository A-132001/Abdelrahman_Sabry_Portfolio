                        <p>This donation platform is one of the projects I‚Äôm most proud of ü§ç. It was a great opportunity to apply my backend development skills using Django and to dive deeper into building real-world systems with authentication, APIs, and secure data handling.</p>

                        <p>When I started this project, I had just finished mastering Django‚Äôs MVT architecture, JWT authentication, and third-party OAuth integrations. I wanted to bring all this together in one meaningful project that can actually help others.</p>

                        <p>At first, it looked like a straightforward platform, but it quickly turned into a complex system, especially since it involved three tightly connected Django apps: <strong>accounts</strong>, <strong>campaigns</strong>, and <strong>transactions</strong>.</p>

                    <ParagraphLight>
                        <p>Implementing email verification, Facebook login, and password recovery taught me a lot about authentication systems and user experience. Also, integrating JWT tokens securely pushed me to better understand token-based APIs üîê.</p>

                    <ParagraphLight>
                        <p>I also faced several challenges when designing how campaigns and transactions relate to each other. Modeling these relationships with foreign keys and making sure the data flow was smooth really sharpened my understanding of Django‚Äôs ORM.</p>

                            Building this Coffee Shop website was an important milestone in my full-stack journey. Instead of just following tutorials, I decided to put my Django skills to the test and create a full-featured e-commerce-style project using Django, PostgreSQL, and HTML/CSS templates. It‚Äôs a realistic, practical application that showcases authentication, search, product listing, and checkout systems ‚Äî everything a real user would expect. ‚òï

                        <p>
                            This project gave me hands-on experience with how real-world applications are structured. I learned how to connect Django with PostgreSQL and how to manage user authentication, product models, and order logic cleanly and securely.

                        <p>
                            I also understood how important good HTML structure is when using Django templates. It helped me style the pages efficiently and add dynamic content without breaking the design.

                            Styling the pages using CSS3 and Tailwind taught me a lot about responsive design and layout best practices. I‚Äôm now more confident in keeping designs consistent and clean. üé®

                            This was also my first time implementing a full checkout system and paginated product views. I gained a clearer picture of how back-end logic works together with front-end presentation to deliver a seamless user experience. üõí
