                        My journey into tech began during my high school years, where my passion for problem-solving and curiosity about how things work naturally drew me into programming and web development.

                        I started out exploring C and Arduino through Samsung Innovation Campus, where I worked on a smart home project. That experience sparked my love for building real-world solutions and taught me the value of hands-on learning.

                        Later, I dived deeper into coding through problem-solving and data structures, eventually working with languages like Python and JavaScript. I enjoyed creating useful scripts and building my logic skills through platforms like Codeforces and HackerRank.

                        While studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Sohag University, I developed a strong foundation in software engineering. My graduation project was an ERP system using facial recognition ‚Äî combining practical back-end development with a meaningful real-world application.

                        I also joined the ITI Full-Stack track to push my skills further, learning advanced back-end tools like Django, DRF, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, and front-end technologies like React and Next.js. These tools helped me bring ideas to life in a more complete and efficient way.

                        Along the way, I‚Äôve shared knowledge with others as a web instructor in GDSC and a programming mentor in Samsung‚Äôs programs. Teaching not only solidified my understanding but made me more passionate about the tech community.

                        I‚Äôm now focused on becoming a professional full-stack developer. I enjoy building clean APIs, improving UI/UX, and solving challenges that help products grow and scale. Whether I‚Äôm designing a database schema or tweaking a front-end layout ‚Äî I‚Äôm all in.

                        I may still be early in my career, but I‚Äôm learning every day, building real projects, and pushing myself to grow with every opportunity. I believe in continuous learning and that success comes from persistence and passion.
